# OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.0 Functions

This project demonstrates a simple OpenGL program for rendering a textured cube.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [SOIL](https://www.lonesock.net/soil.html)
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kadir764/OpenGL.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd OpenGL_Internship/..
    ```
There are different directories to run different examples. You can go directory according to what you want to run.

3. Compiler code:
g++ -o Main2 Main2.cpp ShaderUtil.cpp -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw -I/home/kadir/Documents/OpenGL_Start/OpenGL_Start/source/glm/glm -lSOIL
After compiling it you can directly call the Main2 to see output. For some examples there is no need for the SOIL library thus you can delete it.
Also do not forget to change Main2 and Main2.cpp according to .cpp file's name.


4. There are a file named openegl.docx which explain in detail all functions using example. Also I will put short explanation for the visualizable functions.

5. Uniform qualifier:
